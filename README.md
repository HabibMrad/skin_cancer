TODO:

- Look for other medical data sets, hopefully binary

- Make seperate Interactive Notebook: Ideas
	- leaderboard
	- compares to latest papers?
	- visualizes what the model looks like
	- shows the heatmap of what the model focuses on

Model Tuning/Improvement:

- Check latest papers, architecture, tricks, data-sets?

- fp-16 training

- weight decay parameter increase?

- mess with data augmentation, warp, lighting, rotate

- iterative resizing

- hotdog, not-hotdog ensemble

- what is spatial dropout?

- include all validation data for training
